- More comment-based documentation.

- up: alias for Invoke-Up.
- ArgumentCompleters for New- and Remove-NavigationEntry.
- Invoke-Last: jump back and forth to the last path reached with GoPS.
- last: alias for Invoke-Last.

### Changed

- Moved away from a largely I/O-centric.
- Most manipulation is done in module memory.
- Export- and Update- verbs now set and load when needed.
- -DefaultNavigationFile: mostly unchanged, but slightly tweaked to play wit the new internal data structures.
