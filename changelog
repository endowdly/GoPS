# Changelog

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD024-->

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

This project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.1.0] - 13 Mar 2021

### Fixed

- `Get-NavigationDatabase`: Path parameter now functions as intended
- `New-NavigationFile`: removed ValidationScript attribute to Path parameter.
This attribute made it hard to create new files at the given Path.

### Deprecated

- `Export-NavigationDatabase` renamed to `Export-NavigationEntry` to more accurately reflect its noun.
Expect `Export-NavigationDatabase` to be removed after all current issues are closed.

### Changed

- this changelog to comply with semver
- this changelog to be in reverse chronological order (last to first)
- this changelog to qualify function names (no aliases).
Also, to be more explicit about details in `Added`, `Changed`, and `Removed` sections.
This will not be retroactive because I am lazy.
- todo file layout to be more tree-like.
I find this format easier to follow with more succinct grammar.
- `Invoke-Up`: added ArgumentCompleter attribute to Value parameter
- `Export-NavigationDatabase`: changed InputObject parameter from type Database to Entry[].
This will allow `Export-NavigationDatabase` to accept output from `Get-NavigationEntry`.
- `Get-NavigationEntry` now filters Entry objects in navigation files in addition to its current behavior.
The Path parameter accepts incoming path strings (to include wildcard strings) or objects with a Path property.
- Updated `Get-NavigationEntry` comment-based help
- Renamed `Export-NavigationDatabase` to `Export-NavigationEntry`
- Added `Export-NavigationDatabase` alias to `Export-NavigationEntry`
- Added a warning when calling `Export-NavigationDatabase`
- Updated en-US culture resource file to reflect deprecation of `Export-NavigationDatabase`
- Updated `Invoke-Up` comment-based help

## [2.0.2] - 06 Mar 2021

### Changed

- argumentCompleter for `{get,rm,}go` functions/cmdlets now matches on partial token
- argumentCompleter for `go` also matches partial directories in the cwd
- minor code reformat

## [2.0.1] - 27 Feb 2021

### Added

- vscode settings and extension recommendation (to help my abysmal spelling)

### Fixed

- Jumping to non-qualified paths
- Adding non-qualified paths to the database record

### Changed

- updated this changelog
- added ideas to the todo file

## [2.0] - 20 Feb 2021

After migrating across several computers, I've noticed I have huge issues.
Time for a total rework.

### Added

- Internal module classes handle data allocation.
- Internal data stack to better track jumps and history.
- More comment-based documentation.
- New Noun: NavigationDatabase.
- Export-NavigationDatabase: handles moving jump paths to file.
- Update-NavigationDatabase: handles updating database from a file.
- Invoke-Up: A rejiggering of my work on Up by Shannon Moeller for PowerShell.
- up: alias for Invoke-Up.
- ArgumentCompleters for New- and Remove-NavigationEntry.
- Invoke-Last: jump back and forth to the last path reached with GoPS.
- last: alias for Invoke-Last.

### Changed

- Moved away from a largely I/O-centric.
- Most manipulation is done in module memory.
- Export- and Update- verbs now set and load when needed.
- DefaultNavigationFile: mostly unchanged, but slightly tweaked to play wit the new internal data structures.
- New-NavigationFile: to handle new data file creation.
- Remove-NavigationEntry has lost the ability to receive input from Get-NavigationEntry; this will be re-added later.

### Fixed

- Tab completion issues.
- File import issues.
- Duplicate token issues.
- Token wildcard issues.

## [1.0] - 19 Mar 2019

- Init and I don't rememeber what I did.
- It should have never been considered 1.0.0 though.
